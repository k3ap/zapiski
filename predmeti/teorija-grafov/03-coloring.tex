\naslov{Coloring}

\begin{remark}
  In any graph,
  $\omega(G) \le \chi(G) \le \Delta(G)+1$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  As the color classes are independent sets, the number of vertices in a color
  class is at most $\alpha(G)$, so
  \[
	\chi(G) \ge \frac{n(G)}{\alpha(G)}.
  \]
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}[Welsh-Powel]
  If $d_1 \ge d_2 \ge \cdots \ge d_n$ is the degree sequence of the vertices of
  $G$, then
  \[
	\chi(G) \le 1 + \max_{i=1, \ldots, n} \{ \min \{d_i, i-1\} \}.
  \]
\end{theorem}
